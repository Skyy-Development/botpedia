## History

[CivilityAI](/bots/civilityai/README.md) started off as an AI moderation bot to moderate messages within the channels of Discord servers, which is where the name likely originated from.

On the 15th of November 2024, [Skycodee](/developers/skycodee/README.md) ran a poll on whether to add Text-To-Image capabilities to CivilityAI, and people voted in favour of yes, meaning that on the same day, image generation from a text prompt would now be added in the form of a new command; `/imagine`.
