# [Botpedia](/README.md) - [Bot in Gleam](/bots/botingleam/README.md)

## Introduction
[Bot in Gleam](/bots/botingleam/README.md) was a bot made by [Cyteon](/developers/cyteon/README.md), which was programmed in the programming language of Gleam, which is where the name likely originated from.

The bot used [Cyteon](/developers/cyteon/README.md)'s own DiscordAPI wrapper for interacting with the DiscordAPI in Gleam, as shown in [this GitHub repo of his](https://github.com/cyteon/discord_gleam).

The bot doesn't contain much, with no About Me, and just a profile picture of the Gleam icon.

The bot's slash commands are incredibly simple, with just `/test`, and `/test2`, with both of the commands having a `test` option as a String variable, with `/test` responding with `yay` by default, and `/test2` responding with `test2`.

The bot also used to have a `/ping` command, as well as a `/pong` command, likely for more testing with how it interacts with the DiscordAPI.

The bot also has prefix commands, with these being some of the highlights:

- `!ban`
- `!embed`
- `!kick`
- `!ping`
- `!reply`

Unsurprisingly, they all served their respective actions, as shown within the command names, so there really isn't much more explaining to do on that side of things.

## Summary
This bot has been offically classified on [Botpedia](/README.md) as `offline, maintained, likely a project bot`, as this bot isn't widely used, or is meant to be accessible for the public to invite to their servers, and the bot's functionality is very minimal, but the bot does appear to be maintained occassionally, resulting in this classification being granted.
