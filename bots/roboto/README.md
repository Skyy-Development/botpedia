# [Botpedia](/README.md) - [Roboto](/bots/Roboto/README.md)

## Introduction
[Roboto](/bots/Roboto/README.md) was a bot made by the group of [Roboto Development](/groups/Roboto%20Development/README.md), however, the main contributors to the bot were [RoboticRobot](/developers/RoboticRobot/README.md), as well as [Adelto](/developers/Adelto/README.md), as shown within the bot's About Me.

The bot was a multi-purpose bot, ranging with features like jokes, moderation, anti-nuke, fun facts, and other miscellaneous features, and used `discord.js` to interact with the DiscordAPI.

## Hosting
[Roboto](/bots/Roboto/README.md) previously relied on Replit for hosting, but as of the 20th of July 2023, [Roboto](/bots/Roboto/README.md) migrated from Replit to Sparkle for hosting in order to expand the infrastructure for the bot to accommodate more users.

The VPS specs have been claimed to have been 3 CPU cores, with 110% going to [Roboto](/bots/Roboto/README.md), and the other 190% going to other services, which were never revealed to the public. The VPS also had a maximum of 3GB of RAM, as well as 40GB of SSD storage.

## ReBot
[ReBot](/bots/ReBot/README.md) was a version of [Roboto](/bots/Roboto/README.md) which would've been completely remade in Python, but would have been locked to [Roboto](/bots/Roboto/README.md) Premium users only, due to the amount of effort required to remake [Roboto](/bots/Roboto/README.md) into a brand new language, with a new API wrapper.

[ReBot](/bots/ReBot/README.md) was announced on the 21st of July 2023, and was last mentioned by [RoboticRobot](/developers/RoboticRobot/README.md) on the 25th of July 2023, before never being mentioned again.

You can learn more about [ReBot](/bots/ReBot/README.md) at its official [Botpedia](/README.md) page to learn more.

## Security Vulnerability
Around August 2024, a security vulnerability was found by a developer going by the name of [Zayaan AR](/developers/Zayaan%20AR/README.md), where if a user typed in the phrase of `???`, the bot would react with a message indicating that [Roboto](/bots/Roboto/README.md) was unable to find a command, and that it was likely coming soon.

This allowed for the end user to repeatedly spam the phrase continually, and [Roboto](/bots/Roboto/README.md) had no such ratelimit for the scenario to occur, and so this could be severely misused by the end-user to assist in potential server raids if the server contained [Roboto](/bots/Roboto/README.md) as a member.

When this was pointed out to [RoboticRobot](/developers/RoboticRobot/README.md), they said that "it would be fixed in a later update", which never came out until 2 MONTHS LATER, when another developer by [Seif](/developers/seif/README.md), had to yet again, manually point out the security flaw in order for [RoboticRobot](/developers/RoboticRobot/README.md) to push a patch to [Roboto](/bots/Roboto/README.md) to fix this.

Finally, on the 21st of October 2024, [Roboto](/bots/Roboto/README.md) was taken offline to fix the security issue, with [RoboticRobot](/developers/RoboticRobot/README.md) claiming that, in their exact words, `@everyone we spotted a "Very critical" server security risk in Roboto, which is being fixed asap`, which CLEARLY was not fully displaying the severity of the issue, given the fact that it took TWO WHOLE MONTHS to finally put out an annoucement and patch for this. It ended with the appropriate action only being accessible within the context of DMs, which finally, mitigated the issue entirely.

## Shutdown
On the 12th of November 2024, a developer under the name of [Zayaan AR](/developers/Zayaan%20AR/README.md), noticed that [Roboto](/bots/Roboto/README.md) was offline, and shortly informed [RoboticRobot](/developers/RoboticRobot/README.md) of the issue. On the 13th of November 2024, [RoboticRobot](/developers/RoboticRobot/README.md) finally responded with the statement of `im not funding the server anymore`, and `Lost interest in programming`, indicating that [Roboto](/bots/Roboto/README.md) was officially shutdown after this date, and would no longer be functional.

When questioned about whether one of his other groups would stay active, that being [Codewave](/groups/Codewave/README.md), he officially replied with: `Unfortunalety, yes`, indicating that Codewave services would also no longer be maintained.

## Summary
This bot has been offically classified on [Botpedia](/README.md) as `permanently shutdown`, as [RoboticRobot](/developers/RoboticRobot/README.md) has offically stated that the bot has been shutdown. This classification will stay as-is, as there is no more evidence required in order to change the classification of this bot, unless the bot does get revived.
