# [Botpedia](/README.md) - [Atom Status](/bots/Atom%20Status/README.md)

## Introduction
[Atom Status](/bots/Atom%20Status/README.md) is a bot made by a group under the name of [AtomLabs](/groups/AtomLabs/README.md), and is primarily maintained by [Zayaan AR](/developers/Zayaan%20AR/README.md), as well as [kz](/developers/k_z./README.md).

[Atom Status](/bots/Atom%20Status/README.md) was a bot designed to monitor activity of [AtomLabs](/groups/AtomLabs/README.md) services, including all of their bots, nodes, websites, etc, so that it would be easy to tell whether a service was online or offline at a given time.

The bot does not have any slash, or prefixed commands, and simply outputs an embed into the [status channel of Atom Support](https://discord.com/channels/1252393773468745852/1286045473119141949), which updates with the latest information every 60 seconds to keep users informed.

## Summary
This bot is classified on [Botpedia](/README.md) as `online, internal usage only`, due to how the bot is consistently online (pretty unsurprising for a bot DESIGNED to display status), and that it is only accessible within the Atom Support Discord server, and is not publicly invitable to any other Discord servers.
